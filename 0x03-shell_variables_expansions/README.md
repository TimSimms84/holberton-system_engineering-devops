This is the README for the 0X03 project from Holberton

0. - creat a script that creates an alias
	name: ls
	value: rm *
	This script creates a new alias that will change the ls command to remove all files.

1. - Create a script that prints hello user, where user is the current Linux user.
	This script echos "hello user" but the user is a variable of the current logged in user.

2. -	Add /action to the PATH. /action should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program.
	This script adds the /action directory to the PATH variable.
3. - Create a script that counts the number of directories in the PATH.
	This script prints the PATH, breaks each directory onto it's own line using only one colon,and then counts each		line.
4. - Create a script that lists environment variables.
	the "printenv" command list enviroment variables.
5. - Create a script that lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions.
	The "set" command will show local variables, envrioment variables, and functions.
6. - Create a script that creates a new local variable. Name: Best Value: School
	This creates a variable named Best with the value of School
7. - Create a script that creates a new global variable.
	
This script creates a global variable named BEST with the value of School
8. - Write a script that prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable TRUEKNOWLEDGE, followed by a new line.
	Used the Echo command to add 128 to the global variable TRUEKNOWLEDGE
9. - Write a script that prints the result of POWER divided by DIVIDE, followed by a new line.

	This script uses echo to divide a variable POWER by variable DIVIDE
10. - Write a script that displays the result of BREATH to the power LOVE
	This script uses echo to uses exponents to take variable BREATH to the power of LOVE
11. - Write a script that converts a number from base 2 to base 10.
	This script uses echo to take a binary number stored in variable BINARY to converts it to decimal. "2#" tells the script that the variable has a number stored as Binary and will print it in decimal

12. - Create a script that prints all possible combinations of two letters, except oo
	Used the echo command and make a list of every letter combiation. Uses tr to replace spaces with line breaks, and used grep -v to print everything except what grep found

13. - Write a script that prints a number with two decimal places, followed by a new line.
	used printf function % to define a decimal place with 2 decimals on the variable NUM
14. - Write a script that converts a number from base 10 to base 16.
        used printf function to define hexadecimal (lowercase x) which will print back in decimal
